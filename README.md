# Proximity üìç

## Introduction
With so many unknowns about the future of the coronavirus pandemic and our world, it‚Äôs hard to determine, with certainty, how safe you really are. This app is a way to understand your potential level of risk based on your behaviors, social contacts, and whereabouts and get back some peace of mind.

Our app is a platform to keep track of your contacts and whereabouts, connect with friends and loved ones to see theirs, and get current estimates of your COVID-19 risk.

Created with React, Redux, Node.js, Express, and Neo4j.
