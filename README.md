## Introduction
With so many unknowns about the future of the coronavirus pandemic and our world, itâ€™s hard to determine, with certainty, how safe you really are. This app is a way to understand your potential level of risk based on your behaviors, social contacts, and whereabouts and get back some peace of mind.

Our app is a platform to keep track of your contacts and whereabouts, connect with friends and loved ones to see theirs, and get current estimates of your COVID risk.

Created with React, Redux, Node.js, Express, and Neo4j.
